# Pong
## Assignment
For this assignment, we were required to implement an AI player paddle for the classic Pong game. We were given an introduction to Lua and the Love2D framework.

## Notes
One thing to note, is that the AI is only as good as the fps. I decided to test my AI against my boyfriend's AI paddle. It was a close call, but thanks to pure luck, my AI paddle managed to beat his. 

As the ball speeds up, it skips through the paddle and never actually "hits" it. If the frame of the ball skips past the ball, then you score!

## Future Improvements
I hope to begin implementing additional features to this Pong game, including but not limited to, a margin of error for the AI paddle so one could realistically play against it, an option to play 2 player instead of against the AI, and updated graphics, including powerups.
